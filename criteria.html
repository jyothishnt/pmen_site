              <strong>Criteria for inclusion of global clones in the Network are as follows:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Clone can be resistant to one or more antibiotics that are in wide clinical use; or a global susceptible clone known to be important in disease
</li>
                <li>Clone can be resistant to one or more antibiotics that are in wide clinical use; or a global susceptible clone known to be important in disease
</li>
                <li>Data on the clone needs to be published or in press before ratification by the network.
</li>
                <li>New clones for consideration into the network need to be proposed at annual PMEN meeting.
</li>
                <li>Clone must be made available to the network for typing analyses and confirmation before acceptance into the network.
</li>
                <li>Clone must be made available for deposit into the ATCC collection of clones.
</li>
                <li>Clones will be also available through the Streptococcus Reference Laboratory in Germany and Emory University in USA

              <strong>The nomenclature for the naming of clones is as follows:</strong>
              <p>

                Country <sup>first identified serotype</sup> &#8211;
                sequential numbering in network &#8211; subsequent described
                serotype


                <p>ex. <strong>Spain<sup>23F</sup>-1</strong></p>


                <ul>
                  <li>Spain = country in which the clone was first identified
                    (based on publication)</li>
                  <li><sup>23F</sup> = serotype of the clone first identified</li>
                  <li>1 = clone number 1</li>
                </ul>



              Several publications have shown that members of a single
                clone may express different capsular polysaccharides.
                In the case of capsular switch the nomenclature is as
                follows:


              ex. <strong>Spain<sup>23F</sup>-1-19F</strong>



                <ul>
                  <li>19F = serotype 19F variant of Spain<sup>23F</sup>-1
                    clone</li>
                </ul>
