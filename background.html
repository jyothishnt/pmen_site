              The Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network (PMEN) was established in 1997 under the auspices of the International Union of Microbiological Societies (IUMS) following discussions between Prof Keith Klugman and Dr Helena Makela. The Network was established with the aim of global surveillance of antibiotic resistant S.pneumoniae and the standardization of nomenclature and classification of resistant clones. The network is run by the Department of International Health at Emory University in conjunction with the Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit of the Diviision of the National Health Laboratory Service, South Africa and the Respiratory Disease Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta USA. Members of the Network meet annually to discuss publications of new clones and their possible acceptance into the Network collection. Collections are available through the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

The network now meets every two years to discuss inclusion of new clones.  The PMEN has decided to include major invasive antibiotic-susceptible clones that have a wide geographic spread.  Potential candidate clones and information can be submitted to curator Lesley McGee.
